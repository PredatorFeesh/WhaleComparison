# Whale Comparison
This is a project I have not had much time to work on due to challenging school work and a myriad of AP classes; however, I will continue working on this as soon as I have time. 
# What is the Whale Comparison?
For now, this is just a database that takes pictures chosen in JFileChooser and uploads them into it's own folders and then displays them in the JFrame.
# Future improvement?
Actually making the algrithem filter through the pictures and use either a method by tracing the tail or tracing the color in order to guess which pictures taken are of the same whale.
